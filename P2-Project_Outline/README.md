## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here: My app will essentially make the lives of freight brokers much easier. A large part of shipping freight is keeping track of your loads. Customers will often copy and paste loads from their excel files and send it to the broker looking for a status of the load. My app will allow the user to take the loads and keep track of them in a much more useful and user friendly manner than an excel file can do. Even if a user does not receive an email with loads to check on, the user will have a place to store and keep track of the loads they are responsible for especially if their company's load board does not have a feature to sort by broker. 
The idea came from my own experience being in the freight industry for 7 years. I have always thought there had to be easier ways to get this taken care of. I have also used 3 separate systems in the freight brokering industry and even though 2 of them had a away to filter the load board by the broker, it would still be very beneficial to have a separate app to keep track of the loads that are covered so the user can keep an eye on the loads that are not covered and keep their load board on that screen. 

### Features
Include Features here: 1.Several text boxes to add the load number, carrier email, and the times to check on. So once you get the email from the customer you can quickly copy and paste their id number into your system and get the load number and carrier email and copy the information from there and enter a time you think that it should be checked on. 
2. The second feature is once the loads are added it creates a list of the loads with the times visible that they need to be checked on. 
3. Thirdly an alert feature to alert the user that the time for the load to be checked on has passed.
4. This feature might be after the MVP is done, but I would like for it to email the carrier at the time entered and send them a simple “ is the load ok? Click yes or no.”

### Technologies
Include Technologies here: Javascript, Angular, HTML, CSS 
### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here: Most of this technologies I will have to learn on a deeper scale. However the 4th feature I do not have any idea where to start with that.
